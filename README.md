Project README for the `ze-ui` repo

## ze-ui
Ze is a platform for building a Zettelkasten. This repository contains the UI code for the project.

## What is Vite?
Vite is, in short, a build tool. It is described as a 'native-ESM powered web dev build tool'. It has a nice dev experience. It is well
designed. It is fast, highly configurable and widely approved. 

### Config

When running vite from the command line, Vite will automatically try to resolve a config file named vite.config.js inside project root (other JS and TS extensions are also supported).

##Â Getting started
If you are spinning this up as a devcontainer this is largely managed for you. The only thing you will need to do once the container is up
and running is to install the dependencies. This project uses `npm` not `yarn`.
